## ⚖️ Balance Observations

### Strengths
1. **Clear Progression**: Each business tier provides meaningful upgrades
2. **Prestige Incentive**: Strong motivation to reset and gain permanent bonuses
3. **Multiple Income Sources**: Tapping + passive income creates engagement
4. **Scaling Costs**: 1.15x multiplier prevents infinite purchasing

### Potential Issues
1. **Exponential Tap Costs**: 2x cost growth may be too steep
2. **Upgrade Timing**: Some upgrades cost 10x+ the base business
3. **Mid-Game Gap**: Large jump from Smuggling ($2.5K) to Construction ($12.5K)
4. **Critical Hit Variance**: 5x-13x range creates high RNG dependency

### Suggested Tweaks
1. **Tap Upgrade Costs**: Consider 1.5x instead of 2x growth
2. **Mid-Tier Business**: Add business between $5K-10K range
3. **Upgrade Costs**: Reduce to 5x-8x base business cost
4. **Critical Range**: Narrow to 6x-10x for more consistent gameplay
